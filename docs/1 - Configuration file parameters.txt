Step to handle the cross calibration of the data. Derives the calibrator gains from the flux or polarised calibrator,
 optionally solves for leakage and polarisation angle and transfers the solutions to the target data.

crosscal_mode (string):
Mode of cross calibration. At the moment only the 'WSRT' option is available reliably until we can do proper cross
calibration for APERTIF. Mode 'APERTIF' is experimental and does not include any application of system temperatures,
noise source corrections etc.
crosscal_fringestop (bool):

source model in the phase centre for each individual integration time before deriving bandpass and calibrator gains.
crosscal_fringestop_mode (string):
Mode for the fringe stopping correction. At the moment only 'direct' is supported. This mode does a phase calibration
 on a point source in the field centre before deriving any other calibrator gains.
crosscal_applysys (bool):
Apply system temperatures before starting the calibration. There seems to be a bug during conversion or in the attsys
 task at the moment. It causes blanking of channels during imaging.
crosscal_bandpass (bool):
Do a bandpass calibration or not. In case of an non polarisation observation this is done on the flux calibrator. In
case of a full polarisation observation this is done on the polarised calibrator since MIRIAD blanks the polarisation
 products Q, U, and V if gains or bandpass are derived from an unpolarised calibrator to a polarised source.
crosscal_polarisation (bool):
Do polarisation calibration or not. This derives the polarisation leakage and angle from the polarised calibrator
source. At the moment it also triggers the derivation of the bandpass from the polarised calibrator.

The sigma level for the automatic flagging routine.
selfcal_parametric (bool):
Do parametric self calibration before any other iterative self-calibration step. The model is build from an

the model in the field is summed up and multiplied by this number. Sources are then ordered from strongest to
faintest. All sources falling below the flux limit are discarded in the skymodel.
selfcal_parametric_skymodel_distance (float):

must correspond to the number of major cycles.

The solution interval to use in the major cycles for the standard self-calibration in minutes. The length of the list
must correspond to the number of major cycles.

The line step does the continuum subtraction to produce a line dataset. This dataset is also needed for the final
step to do the line imaging.

line_splitdata (bool):
Split the dataset in individual frequency chunks for the continuum subtraction and line imaging. The chunk bandwidth
should be the same as for the self-calibration since gains are copied on a one-by-one basis. The channel bandwidth
can be any value and determines the frequency resolution of your finally imaged line cube.
line_splitdata_chunkbandwidth (float):
Bandwidth of the single frequency chunks for line imaging in GHz. Automatically adjusts the bandwidth to the next
higher number, which guarantees the same number of channels for each chunk. This should be the same as the one used
during self-calibration.

 to the next higher number, which guarantees the same number of channels for each chunk.
line_transfergains (bool):

 be kept in mind when using different parameters for the chunk bandwidth in the self-calibration and line steps.

line_subtract_mode (string):
Mode to use for subtraction of the continuum. Two choises are available: 'uvlin' using the uvlin task in MIRIAD to

final_continuum_image_imsize (int):
Image size for the continuum image in pixels. Images are always square.
final_continuum_image_cellsize (int):
Cellsize of the pixels for the final imaging process in arcseconds.
final_continuum_mode (string):
Mode for the final continuum imaging. Two modes are available: 'mf' using the MIRIAD mfclean task to produce a deep
continuum image by combining all calibrated datasets and imaging the whole data at once or 'stack' which produces a
deep continuum image of each frequency chunk individually and stacks the images in the end weighted by their
theoretical noise.
final_continuum_minorcycle (int):
Number of minor cycles for cleaning and mask creation to produce the deep continuum image.
final_continuum_c0 (float):
Coefficient for mask generation. Within each minor cycle the maximum value in the image is extracted and a mask
 generated using the threshold computed with this formula:
 mask_threshold = (Imax)/((c0 + (minor_cycle-1)*c0))
final_continuum_c1 (float):
Coefficient for mask genaration. After each mask generation, a clean noise threshold is computed with this formula:

theoretical_noise_threshold = nsigma*theoretical_noise
final_continuum_extraiterations (int):
Additional iterations for the cleaning after the last minor cycle. This last iterations then do not use any mask and
clean 80% of the inner part of the image. Very useful if images are confused or very diffuse extended structures are
present, which are not caught by the masking. Set to 0 to switch off.
final_line (bool):
Produce a final line cube of the dataset. This needs at least one execution of the line step before it can produce
the cube.
final_line_image_imsize (int):
Image size for the line cube in pixels. Images are always square.
final_line_image_cellsize (int):
Cellsize of the pixels for the final line imaging process in arcseconds.
final_line_image_mode (string):
Mode for the imaging of the line cube. Two modes are available: 'channel' which images each channel individually and
combines all channels in the end into a final cube or 'chunk' which produces a single cube out of each frequency
chunk and combines these chunks in the end into a final cube. 'channel' might be needed since MIRIAD assumes a linear
 behaviour of freqeuncies with velocities.
final_polarisation = True
final_polarisation_image_imsize = 1537
final_polarisation_image_cellsize = 4
final_polarisation_makecube = True
